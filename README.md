# Computer Graphics Final Project
## Marittya Keu

### Description
The goal of the final project is to implement a shape editor which supports the follow shapes:
 - Line [x]
 - Triangle [x]
 - Sqaure (Rectangle) [x]
 - Circle (Ellipse) [x]
 - Poly-Line [ ]
 - Polygon [x]
 
It is also able to do the following:
 - Selection [x]
 - Translation [x]
 - Scaling [x]
 - Rotation [x]
 - Save  [ ]
 - Load Diagram [ ]
 
 I used a JavaScript library called [FabricJS](http://fabricjs.com/ "Fabric's Homepage") to implement all of the shapes and the translationg, scaling, etc.
 I also used Materialized CSS framework to do most of the styling.
